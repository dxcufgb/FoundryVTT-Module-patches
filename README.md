The full guide is in the [wiki](https://github.com/dxcufgb/FoundryVTT-Module-patches/wiki):

- [Patches](https://github.com/dxcufgb/FoundryVTT-Module-patches/wiki/Patches): what each patch fixes (PopOut!, Monk's TokenBar, the ruler)
- [Settings](https://github.com/dxcufgb/FoundryVTT-Module-patches/wiki/Settings): every patch and option, with defaults

## Releasing

For the maintainer: **Actions → Release module → Run workflow**, type the version (for example `1.2.3`) and run it. The module is checked and packaged first; only then is the release `v1.2.3` published with `module.json` and `module.zip`. CI and releases come from [dxcufgb/foundry-module-ci](https://github.com/dxcufgb/foundry-module-ci), the same for every module.
